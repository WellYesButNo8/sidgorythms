I started coding when I was nine, on my tablet on this app called tynker. It wasn't what I'd call coding now, but it was my very first adventure into actually getting something on a computer to do what I want. When I turned 11, my mom let me borrow her old laptop, and I got cracking on an online compiler called repl.it. I would spend every day making python scripts that did all sorts of useless things. Choose your own adventures, crop planting simulator (in the terminal, that too. Where did I think we were? the earliest of the early 2000s??). Counting tynker, I have about 4 years of experience in python and about a few months in Go.
